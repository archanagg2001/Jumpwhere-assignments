    <header><h1>CSS-Cascading Style Sheet</h1></header>
    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a
    markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone
    technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript</p>
    <p> CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. This
    separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
    characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file,
    which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the
    page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
    <h2>Selector</h2>
    <p style="font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif"> "CSS class" redirects here. For non-CSS use of element classes in HTML, see class attribute (HTML).
    In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup
    itself.</p>
    <p>Selectors may apply to the following:
    <ul>
    <li>all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2
    elements specified by attribute, in particular:</li> 
    <ul>
    <li>id: an identifier unique within the document, denoted in the selector language by a hash prefix e.g. #id</li>
    <li>class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document, denoted by a dot prefix e.g. .classname (the
    phrase "CSS class", although sometimes used, is a misnomer, as element classes—specified with the HTML class
    attribute—is a markup feature that is distinct from browsers' CSS subsystem and the related W3C/WHATWG standards work on
    document styles; see RDF and microformats for the origins of the "class" system of the Web content model)</li></ul>
    <li>elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.</li>
    </ul></p>
